This example displays a mini dashboard with the following contents:

* Address and little Google Maps overview
* Link to create a route to this address from your location
* Links to search for the company in Google and LinkedIn

The example consists of a single HTML page with styles and logic inside it (not including icons).
It does not use any frontend framework or build tool.
